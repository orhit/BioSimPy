**An open-source Python platform for simulating BioMEMS devices, biosensors, and AI-powered calibration in an interactive web dashboard.**

BioSimPy brings laboratory-grade BioMEMS simulation to your browser â€” no expensive software or cleanroom required. Simulate microfluidic flow, model biosensor behavior, and apply AI calibration â€” all through an intuitive web interface.

## ðŸŒŸ What Are BioMEMS?

**BioMEMS** (Biological Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) are miniaturized devices that combine biology, microelectronics, and mechanical components on a single chip. They power:

- ðŸ©º **Lab-on-chip diagnostics** - Complete medical labs on fingertip-sized devices
- ðŸ’‰ **Wearable biosensors** - Continuous glucose monitors, fitness trackers
- ðŸ§¬ **DNA/protein analyzers** - Genetic testing and molecular diagnostics
- ðŸ’Š **Drug delivery systems** - Implantable chips for precise medication release
- ðŸ”¬ **Organ-on-chip** - Miniature human organs for drug testing
